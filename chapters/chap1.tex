\section{Introduction}
Spin glasses are magnetic systems where the frozen-in quenched structural 
disorder leads to conflicting magnetic moments, which prevents the formation 
of long range magnetic ordering, e.g.,ferromagnetic ordering.

The prototype material is a dilute magnetic alloy, with a small amount of 
magnetic impurity (such as Fe, Mn) randomly substituted into the lattice of a 
noble metallic host (i.e. Cu, Au). Insulators such as Eu$_x$Sr$_{1-x}$S, with $x$
between 0.1 and 0.5 also show spin glass behavior.
 
The physics underlying the spin glass behavior comes from the quenched 
randomness: a pair of spins have a roughly equal a priori probability of having
a ferromagnetic or an anti-ferromagnetic interaction. For the dilute magnetic 
alloy, the conduction electron-mediated 
Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yoshida (RKKY) interactions between the localized moments
 oscillates strongly with distance, 
 \begin{equation}
   \label{eq:RKKY}
   J(R)=J_0\frac{\cos(2k_FR+\phi_0)}{(k_FR)^3}, R\rightarrow 0
 \end{equation}
Here $J_0$ and $\phi_0$ are constants, and $k_F$ is the Fermi wave number of the
host metal. Since the distances between the spins are random, some of the $R$
will be positive, some will be negative,
thus forming ferromagnetic/anti-ferromagnetic bonds randomly, and no spin 
alignment would satisfactory all exchange bonds.

Experiments demonstrated some unusual features of spin glass materials, 
including the cusp in the low-field, low-frequency susceptibility and the 
discrepancy of magnetic response between zero-field and field cooling 
measurements, as shown in Fig \ref{fig:experimentsSG}. These facts suggest that spin glass system has no conventional 
long range magnetic ordering and exhibits very slow dynamics.

\section{Theoretical understanding on spin glass}
The simplest model that captures the consequences of disorder is an Ising model 
with quenched randomly disordered couplings, first proposed by Edwards and 
Anderson:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:EA}
  H=-\sum_{\langle i,j \rangle}J_{ij}S_iS_j-h\sum_iS_i
\end{equation}
Here $S_i$ is the spin in a $d$-dimensional lattice that can take values $\pm 1$,
$\langle i,j \rangle$ indicates nearest neighbors with the coupling $J_{ij}$ between 
them, and $h$ is the external field.
 
Two main paradigmatic cases for the $J_{ij}$ in EA model are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Gaussian distribution of random coupling:
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:Jij_Gaussian}
    P(J_{ij})=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp^{-J_{ij}^2/2}
  \end{equation}
\item Bimodal ($\pm J$) distribution of random coupling:
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:Jij_bimodal}
    P(J_{ij})=\frac{1}{2}[\delta(J_{ij}-1)+\delta(J_{ij}+1)]
  \end{equation}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Frustration}
\label{sec:frustration}
Frustration may be present in the Hamiltonian in Eq \ref{eq:EA}, when no spin 
configurations can satisfy all couplings at the same time. 
Figure \ref{fig:frustration} demonstrate two situations where frustrations 
happens. In Fig \ref{fig:frustration_geo}, the two spin on the top and the left
are anti-parallelly aligned due to the anti-ferromagnetic coupling between them,
but there is not an preferred spin direction for the third spin that can satisfy
both the anti-ferromagnetic bonds. In Fig \ref{fig:frustration_quench}, the 
frustration comes from the random distribution of $J_{ij}$.

  }

  \label{fig:frustration}
\end{figure}

The frustration is one of the factors that leads to many features that make 
spin glass a complex system.
These features include: the existence of many metastable states; the rugged energy 
landscape; and dynamical behaviors such as slow relaxation, irreversibility, 
memory effects, hysteresis, etc. 


\subsection{Pictures on the nature of the spin galss phase}
\label{sec:meanfield-model}

An infinite-ranged version of spin glass models 
was proposed by Sherrington and Kirkpatrick (SK).
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:SK}
  H=-\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\sum_{1\le i\le j\le N}J_{ij}S_iS_j
\end{equation}
Here $J_{ij}$ is chosen from a Gaussian distribution in equation 
\ref{eq:Jij_Gaussian}.
This model has an equilibrium phase transition at $T_c = 1$.
For the spin glass phase below $T_c$, Parisi employed a novel ansatz and 
developed a  possible physical interpretation of the nature of spin glass, 
which is now known as the ``Replica Symmetry Breaking'' (RSB) picture. The main
idea behind the picture is that the spin glass phase consists of an infinite 
number of ``pure states'' that form a hierarchy rather than follow simple symmetry
transformation. 
The ultrametric topology of spin glass states can be represented with a 
genealogical tree. Each end point corresponds to a pure state, and branches 
represent clusters, as sketched in Fig. \ref{fig:TreeRSB}.

  \caption{Hierarchical structure of the ensemble of spin-glass states, according
to the RSB picture. The end points represents states; branches (with all their descendents)
represent clusters.}
\end{figure}


RSB is successful in the description of infinite range models, but whether it 
holds in finite dimensions remains a open question. 
A competing picture, known as droplet/scaling, is based on domain-wall 
renormalization group ideas. In this picture, there is only a single of
pure states that are spin-flip-symmetrical at low temperature in any finite 
dimension. 


%\section{Quantities characterizing spin glass}

The quantity $q$ measures the breaking of time-reversal symmetry, and is now 
known as the ‘EA order parameter’.
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:q}
  q=\frac{1}{N}\sum_iS_i^\alpha S_i^\beta=\frac{1}{N}\lim_{T\to \infty}\sum_iS_i(t_0)S_i(t_0+T)
\end{equation}
where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are two copies of lattice with the same disorder 
configuration, but simulated with different random seeds, so they are
statistically independent of each other. 

According to the Parisi solution, for fixed J and (large) N, the structure of 
the overlap is nontrivial, while in droplet picture, the distribution is just 
a pair of delta functions at $\pm 1$.

\section{Difficulties and Outstanding Problems}
The EA model is a deceptively simple problem. %Since it is a classical spin 
%model, one may think that its numerical study can be simply carried out by Monte
%Carlo methods on conventional hardware. 
One of the defining signatures of spin glass systems is their long relaxation 
time. 
For sufficiently low temperatures, the system becomes very sluggish and 
equilibration is prohibitively difficult even for modest systems sizes. 
Moreover, it has been shown that finding the ground state of the three 
dimensional EA model is an NP-hard problem. \cite{Barahona-1982} 
Until recently, there has been no consensus on whether there is a finite spin 
glass critical temperature in the three dimensional EA model.

%It also requires a large number of disorder realizations to reach any 
%meaningful result.

Due to the difficulty in the simulation, there is still no general consensus on
which of the two competing pictures is correct. 
An import discriminator between the theories is the predicted behavior of 
the system when the temperature is decreased in the presence of an applied magnetic
field. 
In the mean field approximation, the de Almeida-Thouless line separates the 
high-temperature paramagnetic phase from the spin glass phase (Fig.\ref{fig:at_rsb}). 
With the droplet/scaling theory, an applied magnetic field is predicted to remove
the phase transition completely (Fig.\ref{fig:at_droplet}).

\end{figure}

Recent work supports that there is only a pair of two ground states in two dimensions.
In four dimensions, the JANUS show evidence for the presence of a spin glass
phase transition in a field. In three dimensions, numerical simulations give 
conflicting results.


\section{Algorithms for spin glass simulation}
The breakthrough in the numerical study of spin glass systems came with the 
introduction of the parallel tempering method. Parallel tempering (PT), also known
as replica exchange, is a simulation method aimed at improving the dynamic 
properties of Monte Carlo sampling. Instead of simulating one Markov chain at 
a time, one runs N copies of the system with random seeds at different 
temperatures, and exchange configurations based on the detailed balance condition.
By making the configurations at high temperatures available to simulations at 
low temperatures, this method allows better sampling over the entire energy
landscape. We discuss this method further in \ref{sec:PT}.

Simulated annealing (SA) is another commonly used algorithm for heuristic optimization,
due to its simplicity and effectiveness. In physics, one usually select the 
energy as the cost function, start the Monte Carlo simulation at a high temperature
and slowly tune down the temperature during the simulation, and in the end the
configuration of the system would stay in a local minimum. With slow-enough annealing
and multiple repetitions, one would expect to find the global minimum.  

Population annealing (PA) combines simulated annealing and Boltzmann weighted 
differential reproduction within a population of replicas to sample equilibrium 
states. Similar to simulated annealing, population annealing involves lowering 
the temperature of the system at a sequence of temperatures. However, PA uses a 
population of replicas and this population is resampled at each time step.
By doing this, PA aims to ensure that the population always stay close to the 
Gibbs distribution. Population annealing is naturally a massively
parallel algorithm, as realistic spin glass simulation using population 
annealing require population sizes of the order $10^6$ or more.
%http://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.05647v2.pdf

Another possibly to overcome the diverging autocorrelation time problem is the 
multicanonical reweighting method. Instead of sampling the the Boltzmann 
distribution $P=\exp(-\beta Ep)$, multicanonical ensemble uses the 
Metropolis–Hastings algorithm with a sampling distribution given by the inverse 
of the density of states of the system. The density of states has to be known 
a priori, or be computed using techniques such as the Wang and Landau algorithm.
